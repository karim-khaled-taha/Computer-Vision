# Robotic_hand-Controlled by IR Remote System

This Arduino-based project uses an infrared (IR) remote to control 5 finger for Robotic_hand, including 5 motors, and an actuator for fingers (simulated with motors). The system allows for different motor movements depending on IR remote commands, making it ideal for finger gesture-based robotic control applications.

## Features

- **Finger Control Using IR Remote**: Control motors that simulate finger movements based on IR remote input.
- **Multiple Motor Control**: Control two motors (thumb and pinky) with adjustable speeds and delays.
  
## Components

- Arduino (Mega or Uno)
- 5 Servo Motors 
- IR Receiver 
- IR Remote
## Components For Hand
Cardboard Hand Frame: The hand structure is made from cardboard, with each finger outlined and cut out. This acts as the base for the robotic hand, and have a threads connected to the joints, mimicking tendons in a real hand.
