# Simple Robotic Hand Controlled with Computer Vision

This project demonstrates a robotic hand system that uses computer vision to detect human finger movements through a webcam and translate them to control each corresponding finger of the robotic hand. The system uses OpenCV for computer vision and an Arduino to drive the motors that control the robotic hand's fingers.

## Features

- **Finger Detection with Computer Vision**: The system uses a webcam to detect the position and orientation of a human hand and recognizes individual finger movements.
- **Arduino-controlled Robotic Hand**: An Arduino board controls the motors responsible for moving the robotic hand's fingers based on the detected finger positions.
- **Real-time Control**: The robotic hand mimics the movements of a human hand in real-time.
- **Adjustable Sensitivity**: You can configure the system's sensitivity to finger movements.
